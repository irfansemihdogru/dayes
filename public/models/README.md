# Face-API.js Models

This directory needs to contain the necessary model files for face-api.js to function properly.

You need to download the following models from the face-api.js repository and place them in this directory:

1. tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
2. tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
3. face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
4. face_landmark_68_model-shard1

These files can be downloaded from: https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Without these files, the face recognition functionality will not work properly.
